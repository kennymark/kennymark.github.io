# Hi there! This is my portfolio website

This website was coded by me form scratch using simple goold ol' HTML, CSS, Javascript and of course JQuery for the cool animations.

To get you started, I included every file needed to build your website upon this. You are free to iterate on this design for your own portfolio website. Just make sure you don't copy this without any changes.

All you have to do is to clone the repo via this command in your command line

`git clone [https://github.com/kennymark/new.git](https://github.com/kennymark/new.git)`
